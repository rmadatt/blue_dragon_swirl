--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhancements:
Logging: Added logging for better traceability and debugging.

Error Handling: Included checks to handle potential issues such as failing to read or preprocess the image.

Preprocessing and Postprocessing: Separated preprocessing and postprocessing steps into their own modules/functions for better modularity and maintainability.

Function Documentation: Added docstrings to explain the purpose and parameters of the run_inference function.

Type Annotations: Used type annotations for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and maintainability.
