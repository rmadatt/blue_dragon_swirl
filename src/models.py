Upgrade: 
Copilot To upgrade the code for production use, we'll enhance it by adding error handling, validation, and logging. We'll also include a complete model-building example. Here's an upgraded version of your code:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model as keras_load_model
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

def load_model(model_path):
    try:
        model = keras_load_model(model_path)
        print(f"Model loaded successfully from {model_path}")
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to load model from {model_path}. Error: {e}")
        return None

def build_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Adjust the number of units according to your number of classes

    return model

# Example usage:
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)
model = build_model(input_shape)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
print("Model built and compiled successfully.")
```

### Enhancements made:
1. **Error Handling**: Added try-except block to handle potential loading errors.
2. **Logging**: Added print statements to provide feedback on loading and building the model.
3. **Complete Example**: Included a full model-building example within `build_model`.

Let me know if you need any further modifications or explanations!
