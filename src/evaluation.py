Enhancements:
Logging: Configured logging to track the progress and potential errors during model evaluation.

Additional Metrics: Included confusion_matrix and roc_auc_score for a more comprehensive evaluation.

Exception Handling: Added a try-except block to handle any potential errors during the evaluation process.

Function Documentation: Included docstrings to explain the purpose and parameters of the evaluate_model function.

Example Usage: Provided an example usage scenario within an if __name__ == "__main__": block to demonstrate how to use the function with sample data.
