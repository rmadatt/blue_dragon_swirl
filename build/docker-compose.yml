Explanation:
Dockerfile: This file defines the environment for your project. It starts with a base image (Python 3.8-slim), sets the working directory, copies your project files into the container, installs dependencies from requirements.txt, exposes a port, sets an environment variable, and specifies the command to run your application.

docker-compose.yml: This file defines how to run multi-container Docker applications. It specifies the build context, ports to expose, volumes to mount, and environment variables.

Steps to Build and Run:
Build the Docker image:

sh
docker build -t your_project_name .
Run the Docker container:

sh
docker run -p 8000:80 your_project_name
This setup will create a Docker environment for your computer vision project, allowing you to run your application in a consistent and isolated environment.
