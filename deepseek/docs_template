Can you help me create documentation for:

API endpoints
System setup
Usage guidelines
Maintenance procedures

  Absolutely! Documentation is crucial for ensuring that your system is easy to use, maintain, and extend. Below is a template for creating documentation for your project, covering API endpoints, system setup, usage guidelines, and maintenance procedures.

Documentation Template
    
1. API Endpoints
This section describes the available API endpoints, their inputs, outputs, and example usage.

Base URL
Copy
https://api.yourdomain.com/v1
Endpoints
1.1. Summarize Transcript
Description: Summarizes a conversation transcript using Amazon Bedrock.

Method: POST

Endpoint: /summarize

Request Body:

json
Copy
{
  "transcript": "The transcript of the conversation.",
  "topics": ["charges", "location", "availability"]
}
Response:

json
Copy
{
  "summary": {
    "version": 0.1,
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "issues": [
      {

        "summary": "The customer was concerned about hidden fees."
      }
    ]
  }
}
Example:

bash
Copy
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/summarize \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "transcript": "The transcript of the conversation.",
  "topics": ["charges", "location", "availability"]
}'
1.2. Get System Status
Description: Returns the current status of the system.

Method: GET

Endpoint: /status

Response:

json
Copy
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z"
}
Example:

bash
Copy
curl -X GET https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/status
2. System Setup
This section provides instructions for setting up the system locally or in a production environment.

2.1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

2.2. Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Set Up a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory:

Copy
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
LEARNERS3BUCKETNAMETEXT=your-s3-bucket-name
2.3. Running the System
Local Development:

bash
Copy
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Production Deployment:
Use Docker to build and run the container:

bash
Copy
docker build -t your-app .
docker run -p 80:80 your-app
3. Usage Guidelines
This section explains how to use the system effectively.

3.1. Using the API
Authentication: Use API keys or AWS IAM roles for secure access.

Rate Limiting: The API allows 100 requests per minute per user.

Error Handling: Check the response status code and body for error details.

3.2. Testing
Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API endpoints.

Example:

bash
Copy
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/summarize \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "transcript": "The transcript of the conversation.",
  "topics": ["charges", "location", "availability"]
}'
3.3. Debugging
Check the logs for detailed error messages.

Use the /status endpoint to verify the system is running.

4. Maintenance Procedures
This section outlines procedures for maintaining the system.

4.1. Monitoring
Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor system performance and errors.

Set up alerts for:

High error rates

Slow response times

System downtime

4.2. Logging
Logs are stored in CloudWatch Logs.

Use structured logging (JSON format) for easier analysis.

4.3. Backup and Recovery
Backup:

Regularly back up the S3 bucket containing transcripts and results.

Use AWS Backup for automated backups.

Recovery:

Restore from backups in case of data loss.

Use CloudFormation to recreate the infrastructure if needed.

4.4. Upgrades
Dependencies:

Regularly update Python dependencies using pip-tools or pipenv.

Infrastructure:

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage upgrades.

4.5. Security
IAM Roles:

Use least privilege principles for IAM roles and policies.

API Security:

Use API keys, OAuth, or AWS Cognito for authentication.

Data Encryption:

Enable encryption for data at rest (S3) and in transit (HTTPS).

5. Troubleshooting
This section provides solutions to common issues.

5.1. API Not Responding
Check if the server is running.

Verify the API endpoint and request format.

5.2. High Error Rates
Check the logs for detailed error messages.

Verify the input data format and content.

5.3. Slow Performance
Optimize the code and database queries.

Scale the infrastructure using AWS Auto Scaling.
