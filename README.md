Computer Vision in Food Safety

## Guide to Coding for Food Safety in Cornmeal and Flour Products

### Introduction
Ensuring food safety in cornmeal and other flour products is crucial to prevent contamination and ensure consumer health. This guide will walk you through the process of using Python and computer vision techniques to monitor and enhance food safety.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Before diving into coding, make sure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. You'll need Python and several libraries for image processing and machine learning.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python
```

### Step 2: Data Collection  
Collect images of cornmeal and flour products. These images should include both safe and contaminated samples. You can use publicly available datasets or create your own by capturing images under controlled conditions.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the images to ensure they are suitable for training a machine learning model. This includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image = cv2.resize(image, (128, 128))
    image = image / 255.0  # Normalize to [0, 1]
    return image

# Example usage
image = preprocess_image('path_to_image.jpg')
```

### Step 4: Building the Model
Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build a model that can classify images of cornmeal and flour products. Here's a simple example using TensorFlow and Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(2, activation='softmax')  # Assuming binary classification: safe vs. contaminated
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Step 5: Training the Model
Train the model using your dataset. Split the data into training and validation sets to monitor the model's performance.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming X contains preprocessed images and y contains labels
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```

### Step 6: Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the model's performance on a test set to ensure it generalizes well to new data.

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
print(f'Validation Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')
```

### Step 7: Deploying the Model
Deploy the model to a production environment where it can be used to monitor food safety in real-time. You can use frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to create a web service for your model.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    image = preprocess_image(request.files['image'].read())
    prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))
    return jsonify({'prediction': 'safe' if np.argmax(prediction) == 0 else 'contaminated'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Conclusion
By following this guide, you can create a system that uses computer vision to enhance food safety in cornmeal and other flour products. This approach helps in early detection of contamination, ensuring that only safe products reach consumers.
