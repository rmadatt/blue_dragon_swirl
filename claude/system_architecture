Prompt: Can you help me design a system architecture diagram showing the key components of the cornmeal quality detection system, including the computer vision pipeline, API endpoints, and data flow?


I'll help you create a detailed system architecture diagram for the cornmeal quality detection system using Mermaid. I'll first think through the key components and data flows we need to represent.


Cornmeal Quality Detection System Architecture

Let me explain the key components and their interactions in this architecture:

Client Layer:
The system provides a web interface built with React for uploading images and viewing results
An optional mobile app could be added for field inspections and real-time analysis
Both clients communicate with the system through the API Gateway
API Layer:
FastAPI serves as the API Gateway, providing a robust, high-performance interface
Authentication and authorization ensure secure access to the system
Request validation ensures data quality and prevents system abuse
Computer Vision Pipeline:
Image Preprocessing handles noise reduction, color normalization, and resolution adjustment
Feature Extraction analyzes texture, color patterns, and identifies potential defects
Anomaly Detection uses machine learning to identify irregular patterns
Quality Classification provides safety scores and categorizes any detected defects
Storage Layer:
PostgreSQL database stores processing results, user data, and system configuration
Object storage maintains the original and processed images
Model storage keeps versioned machine learning models for reproducibility
Monitoring & Logging:
System metrics track performance and resource usage
Application logs capture processing details and errors
Alert system notifies operators of critical issues or severe defects
Key Data Flows:

Images flow from clients through the API to preprocessing
Processed data moves through the computer vision pipeline
Results are stored in the database and sent back to clients
Monitoring data is collected throughout the system
This architecture provides several benefits for your use case:

Scalability: Components can be scaled independently based on demand
Reliability: Monitoring and logging help maintain system health
Security: Authentication and validation protect sensitive data
Flexibility: New components can be added without major changes
Would you like me to elaborate on any particular component or add specific features for your Nigerian context? For example, we could discuss offline processing capabilities or low-bandwidth optimizations that might be relevant for your deployment environment.
